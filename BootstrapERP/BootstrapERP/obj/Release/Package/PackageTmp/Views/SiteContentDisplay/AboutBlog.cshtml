In Barishal, they are being dumped in Puranpara landfill on the bank of Sapanial Khal, a seven-km long canal that flows into the Sandhya River. Left untreated, the germs medical waste harbours easily spread through waterbodies, eventually contaminating the food chain. Experts deem this practice to be “extremely hazardous”. A divisional authority, comprised of the divisional director of Directorate General of Health Services as president, a representative of the respective city corporation as member, and a representative of the Department of Environment (DoE) as member-secretary, is supposed to look after the medical waste management. This is according to the Medical Waste (Management and Processing) Rules 2008, a policy that is merely on paper. As such, the authority it demands, however, has not been formed in any of the divisional headquarters. In the absence of a committee, respective divisional city corporations broker a waste management deal between the healthcare establishment authority and a third party. Similarly, waste collectors from city corporations or a licensed third party carry those medical waste into the landfills and dump it without it being sterilised.")
